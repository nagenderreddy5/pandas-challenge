Obeservations on PySchool data trends:
Nagender Panyala

Trend 1.	It seems the school budget is inversely proportional to the school performance. Schools that are smaller and have a smaller budget per student tend to perform better at both math and reading tests than students from larger schools with bigger budgets per student. 

Trend 2.	Charter schools tend to have a better performance than District schools.

Trend 3.	Math scores varied across schools more than reading scores.  The difference between reading scores at the top schools and bottom schools is much less than the difference between math scores at these schools.
